## Description

The div tags in the HTML of this website have been replaced with semantic ones and images now have alt attributes. The CSS selectors have been changed to reflect this and the rules have been condensed. All this improves the readability of the code and accessibility of the website without changing its appearance. In doing this, I found out about a variety of semantic HTML tags and how to apply CSS rules with the needed specificity using descendant combinators.
